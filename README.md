Write an application in C# that finds the optimal apartment.

There are n blocks, each block has at least one convenience building (a supermarket, a school, or a gym).

Find the best apartment where you have to walk the shortest distance to all three convenience buildings.

 

For example:

{

            [supermarket = false, school = false, gym = true]     // block 1

            [supermarket = false, school = false, gym = true]     // block 2

            [supermarket = true, school = false, gym = true]      // block 3

            [supermarket = false, school = true, gym = false]     // block 4

}

 

The optimal apartment would be in block 3.
